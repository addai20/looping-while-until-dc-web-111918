# 3. Let's get the first test passing by coding our solution in `while.rb`:
# Fill out the content of the `using_while` method so that calling it will `puts` the desired phrase while your levitation force is less than `10`. Remember, every time you `puts` the phrase, you should increment your levitation force by `1`.
